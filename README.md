# Neural Networks for Market Trading

![Project Logo](link-to-your-logo.png)

## Overview

This project explores the use of neural networks for market trading. It aims to develop models that can predict stock prices, identify trading signals, and ultimately make trading decisions. The repository contains all the necessary code, data, and documentation to understand, replicate, and build upon the work.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of various neural network architectures:
  - Feedforward Neural Networks
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for time-series data
- Backtesting framework to evaluate trading strategies
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization
- Visualization of model predictions and trading signals

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-networks-for-market-trading.git
    cd neural-networks-for-market-trading
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your data:
   - Ensure you have the necessary market data in the `data/` directory.
   - You can use the data preprocessing scripts in `scripts/preprocess_data.py` to clean and format your data.

2. Train a model:
   - Use the training scripts available in the `scripts/` directory to train your neural network models.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     python scripts/train_model.py --config configs/lstm_config.json
     ```

3. Evaluate and backtest:
   - Use the evaluation and backtesting scripts to analyze your model's performance.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model checkpoints/lstm_model.pth
     ```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project include historical stock prices, technical indicators, and other relevant financial data. You can find detailed instructions on how to obtain and preprocess these datasets in the `data/` directory.

## Models

This project includes implementations of several neural network architectures suitable for market trading:
- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** Basic neural network with fully connected layers.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Suitable for sequential data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM):** A type of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Applied to time-series data for pattern recognition.

## Results

Detailed results, including model performance metrics, backtesting results, and visualizations, are documented in the `results/` directory and in various Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
